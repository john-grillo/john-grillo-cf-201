       <ul>
         <li>Pt. 1, except for that time he went to those other places.</li>
         <li>Nanjing used to be called Nanking. Yes, it's <strong>that city</strong> where the "Rape of Nanking" occured.</li>
         <ul>
           <li>My best friend in the city literally lived next to the Rape of Nanking Museum. Always an easy subway stop to remember.</li>
           <li>Don't ever speak Japanese in public unless you want to be beaten up.</li>
           <li>Though on my first day I did totally meet a Japanese/Chinese couple who were visiting Nanjing to teach their young son about it.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>Japan is the opposite of China</li>
         <li>It's super clean and crime-free</li>
         <ol>
           <li>Seriously, protests are planned for when they will be the least disruptive possible.</li>
           <li>The TEFL market is completly flooded though. I wouldn't do it.</li>
         </ol>
         <li>Egypt</li>
         <ol>
           <li>The average city seemed like it was paved over with garbage</li>
           <li>Alexandria was totally clean because they contracted with a French garbage company</li>
           <li>Giza is really a Cairo suburb. Seriously. And the least-regarded landmark in Egypt that toally rocked was the Island of Lord Kitchner</li>
         </ol>
       </ul>
